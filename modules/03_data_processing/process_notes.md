# Tools

Trimming is a complex question, being very dependent on the current available
data and the project main objective. Also, a large variety of tools are
available. We are gonna present general guidelines and operation on 3 main
wide-spread tools, but further research is always advised.
- Trimmomatic
- ConDeTri
- BBDuk

# Overview

We are gonna to use the pre-processing information to operate on the files
aiming to get better data. FASTP does a great work in pipelining this portion of
the workflow, because it analyses and already trims data. When opting to use
a separate tool, all precautions are needed, and one must keep in mind that this
step is detrimental to the final result.

# Using the tools
