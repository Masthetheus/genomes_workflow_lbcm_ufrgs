## About the Project

A general repository to store mainly MD files compiling instructions of common bioinformatics tools used in genome assembly and annotation. It aims to help LBCM students to start on the field in a more approachable way but maintaining their autonomy. In this sense, Linux general usage, environment manipulation and doc's referral practice is still present and highly encouraged to be further explored.
